# Bio

I am a Political Scientist by training (PhD, University of Edinburgh) with broad expertise and interest in computational social science. I have held different research positions across Europe and was granted a Marie Sklodowska-Curie Actions Individual Fellowship at the University of Amsterdam (co-funded by the European Commission) titled _Trust Radius_.

My research interests lie at the intersection of political behavior, political psychology, sociology, methodology, and migration studies. In my work I seek to understand the processes behind the creation and loss of generalized trust, confidence in governments, and crime. I am particularly interested in the impact of ethnic diversity and inequality on these phenomena, but also the methodological implications that follow from extant research. I use a wide range of statistical techniques such as multilevel models, structural equation modelling, (spatial) panel analysis, and recently machine learning ensembles. I draw on survey questionnaires, register data, and experimental data.
